DatabaseSetup.py:
File takes the coffee_shop xls file and inserts to mysql and mongodb. 
Points to note:
As stated in the readme, 
- the database in mysql needs to be created manually
- need to explore how to do this to support takinf in the excel file from the enduser
- need to make the setup file extensible to take in the excel file from enduser
- everything else should remain the same ideally
- where would the file inputted by the user be stored????? do we even need to store it before inserting to db???
